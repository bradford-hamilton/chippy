Chippy is a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator that runs Chip-8 public domain roms. The Chip 8 actually never was a real system, but more like a virtual machine (VM) developed in the 70‚Äôs by Joseph Weisbecker. Games written in the Chip 8 language could easily run on systems that had a Chip 8 interpreter.

## Installation
```
go install github.com/bradford-hamilton/chippy
```
I am still getting a bunch of deprecation warnings when building. If you see those warnings just ignore them.

The screen uses CGO which isn't supported by [go-releaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) :( which means unfortunately I don't have a nice releases section with binaries for multiple systems.

## Usage
### Run
Default clock speed: 60Hz
```
chippy run roms/pong.ch8
```

Set clock speed with flag
```
chippy run roms/pong.ch8 --refresh=300
```

### Version
```
chippy version
```
